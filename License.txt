Note the Arc4 symmetric cipher code used in this software comes from the FreeBsd system and was obtained from the LXR Project at the following url:  http://fxr.watson.org/

**********************************************

I simply renamed the arc4 source from a .c to a .cpp file, modified the function declaration / function definition statements appropriately, edited the variable type definitions a bit for my preferences, and renamed the variables slightly to avoid a Linker name collision I was having when using this code in another project.

Thank you FreeBsd / OpenBsd and especially YOU Markus! 


Also note that the MD5 code included in this distribution was obtained from the following url: http://www.fourmilab.ch/ as a distribution named MD5.zip

Again, I simply renamed to .cpp and modified the function declaration / function definition statements accordingly.

The MD5.c source file (renamed to MD5.cpp) contains the following text:
***********************************************
 This code implements the MD5 message-digest algorithm.
 The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest.	This code was
 written by Colin Plumb in 1993, no copyright is claimed.
 This code is in the public domain; do with it what you wish.

 Equivalent code is available from RSA Data Security, Inc.
 This code has been tested against that, and is equivalent,
 except that you don't need to include two pages of legalese
 with every copy.

 To compute the message digest of a chunk of bytes, declare an
 MD5Context structure, pass it to MD5Init, call MD5Update as
 needed on buffers full of bytes, and then call MD5Final, which
 will fill a supplied 16-byte array with the digest.

 Brutally hacked by John Walker back from ANSI C to K&R (no
 prototypes) to maintain the tradition that Netfone will compile
 with Sun's original "cc". 
*********************************************

Also in the main.c  file included with the MD5.zip distribution from the web site (which I have NOT included as it is not necessary) is the following text:
*********************************************
  Calculate or Check MD5 Signature of File or Command Line Argument

			    by John Walker
		                 http://www.fourmilab.ch/

		This program is in the public domain.

Thank you John!
