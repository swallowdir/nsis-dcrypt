; Sample Script showing NGenKeys + Ncrypt / DcryptDll plugin example, installs supporting program
;    NGenKeys.exe itself in some user chosen directory. Note DcryptDll folder and its subfolders MUST
;    exist in NSIS\Contrib directory for this script to work. You also need Modern UI, InstallOptions
;    plugin and the NSIS\Contrib\Graphics installed.
;    Also note the !include .\Get_parent_directory.nsi below: this is just SunJammer's GetParent
;    function wrapped with  !macro GetParent UN   ...  !macroend  and the name of the function changed
;    to:  Function ${UN}GetParent  so it can be called from either Installer or Uninstaller, here its
;    being called from uninstaller (see the !insertmacro GetParent "un." line), thanks SunJammer!

; MAKE SURE YOU HAVE COPIED THE DcryptDll.dll PLUGIN to the PLUGINS Directory before compiling the script!
; The installer exe that gets created will be: ${NSDIR}\Contrib\DcryptDll\NGenKeysSetup.exe

;  This sample demonstrates the Use of the DcryptDll Plugin to decrypt the actual program being installed
;  which is encrypted before being included. This encryption / decryption is an example of a "part of"
;  a Licensing / Registration scheme, where the idea is that we do a CUSTOM installer build for each
;  user. The key that is used for the encryption and decryption BECOMES the "Registration License Key".
;  We would normally Generate this key OUTSIDE the script and send it to the user through a different
;  channel (perhaps email) with instructions to place the file into the same directory as the installer
;  exe itself. We would NOT include the key in installer as shown here.

  ; extract the files
  SetOutPath "$INSTDIR"
  SetOverwrite ifnewer

  ; Note on MY system NGenKeys.exe AND Ncrypt.exe are in a folder that is included in my PATH environement
  ; variable.  To compile THIS script you need to have them available, you could put them in ${NSISDIR}\BIN
  ; and insert a !cd ${NSISDIR}\Bin statement here if you dont have them in one of your PATH folders
  
  ; note: would NORMALLY use some OTHER method (outside NSIS entirely) to generate a key and would then,
  ; SEND the key to the end user through email or something, definitely would NOT include the key file
  ; IN the installer (a TERRIBLE idea).  For THIS demo, however, am going to generate key file AND include
  ; it in the distribution, just to show an example of using the key generator in addition to showing how
  ; to encrypt on development (installer MAKER) system using Ncrypt.exe and how to decrypt on TARGET
  ; system using DcryptDll plugin.

  ; STEP 1: generate a key:
  ; generate a key (using a passphrase for seed (see above note)
  ; 1st parm says generate a key & write it to an output file, HEX encoded, using passphrase as a SEED (-HS)
  ; 2nd parm is desired key size (binary NOT hex encoded size, i.e 8 will produce 16 bytes hex encoded)
  ; 3rd parm is the passphrase, note be sure to enclose the passphrase in quotes if contains whitespace
  ; 4th parm is the name of the keyfile to contain the HEX ENCODED key that gets generated

  ; You would normally want to keep this key in a database along with user registration info in case
  ; the user ever loses it and needs to request it again (or maybe to REQUIRE user to send it back for
  ; verification purposes, etc.)
  
  ; Create an 8 byte key and store in NGenKeys.lky, using "mary had a little lamb" as passphrase for seed
  ; NGenKeys.lky will contain the 8 byte key hex encoded to 16 bytes, DcryptDll will do the necessary
  ; hex DECODING to get it back to an 8 byte binary key on the target machine.
  !system 'NGenKeys "-HS" "8" "mary had a little lamb" "${NSISDIR}\Contrib\DcryptDll\NGenKeys.lky"' = 0
  
  ; STEP 2: compress the file BEFORE encrypting as encrypted data will NOT compress well.
  ; if keyfile created okay, compress the file FIRST as encrypted files dont compress worth a damm!
  ; note on my system, I have put lzma.exe into NSIS\Bin
  !system '${NSISDIR}\Bin\lzma "e" "${NSISDIR}\Contrib\DcryptDll\NGenKeys\NGenKeys.Exe" \
  "${NSISDIR}\Contrib\DcryptDll\NGenKeys.lza" ' = 0

  ; STEP 3: encrypt the compressed file:
  ; file compressed now use Ncrypt.exe to encrypt it using key in file NGenkeys.lky created above
  ; 1st parm (-FF) says use a keyfile containing a hex encoded key to encrypt a FILE to an Output FILE
  ; 2nd parm is the name of the keyfile, 3rd parm is the name of the file to encrypt,
  ; 4th parm is the name of the encrypted file
  !system 'Ncrypt "-FF" "${NSISDIR}\Contrib\DcryptDll\NGenKeys.lky" \
  "${NSISDIR}\Contrib\DcryptDll\NGenKeys.lza" "${NSISDIR}\Contrib\DcryptDll\NGenKeys.dat"' = 0

  ; now that file has been compressed and ENCRYPTED, just do our file statements
  InitPluginsDir
  ; since encrypted files dont compress we compressed BEFORE encrypting, will need to decompress AFTER
  ; decrypting on target system so (for now) inluding lzma itself to do decompression on target system
  ; output to PLUGINSDIR so lzma.exe will get cleaned off target system
  File /oname=$PLUGINSDIR\lzma.exe ${NSISDIR}\Bin\lzma.exe

  ; note here I am including the keyfile (would NOT normally do, see above notes)
  ; also note /oname on file statement as DONT want the encrypted, compressed file to go to $INSTDIR
  ; will need to decrypt (on target system using DcryptDll) 1st, then decompress using above included lzma
  ; on target system. We will decompress to the $INSTDIR, note using $PLUGINSDIR as it gets cleaned up

  ; note extracting key file to $EXEDIR, this is where would probaby tell the user to put the file
  ; if we sent it thru email
  File /oname=$EXEDIR\NGenKeys.lky ${NSISDIR}\Contrib\DcryptDll\NGenKeys.lky ;the key

  ; since file was compressed BEFORE encrypting, tell NSIS NOT to compress
  SetCompress off
  File /oname=$PLUGINSDIR\NGenKeys.dat ${NSISDIR}\Contrib\DcryptDll\NGenKeys.dat ;the encrypted file

  ; turn compression back on (to auto)
  SetCompress auto
